Implementation of algorithms for finding good initial feasible solution when solving general mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems.

Sample code for `nvs20` (MINLP with 16 variables, 5 integer variables and 8 constraints). The code can be adapted to the different alogrithms in the report.

The `nvs20` example and solution achieved can be found at http://www.minlplib.org/nvs20.html
